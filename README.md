# Volcengine Agent Development Kit

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)
[![Deepwiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/volcengine/veadk-python)

An open-source kit for agent development, integrated the powerful capabilities of Volcengine.

For more details, see our [documents](https://volcengine.github.io/veadk-python/).

A [tutorial](https://github.com/volcengine/veadk-python/blob/main/veadk_tutorial.ipynb) is available by Jupyter Notebook, or open it in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/volcengine/veadk-python/blob/main/veadk_tutorial.ipynb) directly.

## Installation

### From PyPI

```python
pip install veadk-python

# install extensions
pip install veadk-python[extensions]
```

### Build from source

We use `uv` to build this project ([how-to-install-uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)).

```bash
git clone ... # clone repo first

cd veadk-python

# create a virtual environment with python 3.12
uv venv --python 3.12

# only install necessary requirements
uv sync

# or, install extra requirements
# uv sync --extra database
# uv sync --extra eval
# uv sync --extra cli

# or, directly install all requirements
# uv sync --all-extras

# install veadk-python with editable mode
uv pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

We recommand you to create a `config.yaml` file in the root directory of your own project, `VeADK` is able to read it automatically. For running a minimal agent, you just need to set the following configs in your `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
model:
  agent:
    provider: openai
    name: doubao-seed-1-6-250615
    api_base: https://ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/v3/
    api_key: # <-- set your Volcengine ARK api key here
```

You can refer to the [config instructions](https://volcengine.github.io/veadk-python/configuration/) for more details.

## Have a try

Enjoy a minimal agent from VeADK:

```python
from veadk import Agent
import asyncio

agent = Agent()

res = asyncio.run(agent.run("hello!"))
print(res)
```

## AgentKit application

Use the shared AgentKit application factory when your project needs AgentKit
APIs, VeADK's bundled Web UI, health checks, and agent-topology endpoints. This
keeps platform routes and lifecycle code out of your agent module:

```python
from veadk import Agent
from veadk.integrations.agentkit import create_agentkit_app

root_agent = Agent(name="customer_support")
app = create_agentkit_app(root_agent)
```

See [`examples/generated_agentkit_project`](examples/generated_agentkit_project)
for a complete generated project.

The Studio deployment flow lists Feishu, knowledge-base, short-/long-term
memory, and observability settings in their feature sections. Values entered
there are mirrored in the deployment environment-variable summary and converted
to VeADK runtime environment variables only when deploying; secrets are not
written to generated source or exported YAML. For multi-instance runtimes, use
a database-backed short-term memory store so sessions remain available across
instances.

When a cloud image build fails from the bundled Web UI, the deployment error
includes a credential-safe excerpt from the build log so dependency and
Dockerfile failures can be diagnosed directly.

## Feishu bot channel

VeADK now provides `veadk.extensions.FeishuChannelExtension` for bridging a Feishu bot with a `Runner`. It maps `union_id` to `user_id`, and `thread_id` / `chat_id` to `session_id`, so VeADK memory and tracing can work directly in Feishu conversations.

```python
from veadk import Agent, Runner
from veadk.extensions import FeishuChannelExtension

agent = Agent()
runner = Runner(agent=agent, app_name="feishu_demo")
channel = FeishuChannelExtension(runner=runner)
```

Configure credentials with `TOOL_FEISHU_CHANNEL_APP_ID` and `TOOL_FEISHU_CHANNEL_APP_SECRET`, or in `config.yaml` under `tool.feishu_channel`.

## A2UI (agent-driven UI)

VeADK integrates Google's [A2UI](https://a2ui.org), letting an agent reply with
declarative UI (cards, rows, forms) instead of plain text. A client renders the
UI with native components. Enable it with a single flag (requires the optional
`a2ui-agent-sdk` dependency: `pip install veadk-python[a2ui]`):

```python
from veadk import Agent

agent = Agent(enable_a2ui=True)  # uses the bundled "basic" component catalog
```

A bundled React web UI renders A2UI over the standard ADK API server. The built
UI ships inside the package (`veadk/webui`, produced by `npm run build`), so
installed users can launch it directly. Its custom-agent workbench supports
in-page debugging followed by source review and AgentKit deployment
configuration:

```bash
veadk frontend --agents-dir examples           # serve UI + API on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

To rebuild the UI from source (output goes to `veadk/webui`, which is committed
so it ships with the wheel):

```bash
cd frontend && npm install && npm run build
```

Point the agent at a custom component catalog (relative paths resolve against the
agent's directory; absolute paths work too). With no argument it auto-discovers a
`catalog.json` next to the agent, falling back to the bundled basic catalog:

```python
Agent(enable_a2ui=True, a2ui_catalog="catalog.json")  # beside the agent
```

Enterprises extend the component set in two matching halves: a backend catalog
(a `catalog.json` or a `veadk.a2ui.BaseA2UICatalog` subclass) and a frontend
renderer directory (`frontend/src/a2ui/components/<Name>/`). See
[`frontend/README.md`](frontend/README.md).

## Command line tools

VeADK provides several useful command line tools for faster deployment and optimization, such as:

- `veadk deploy`: deploy your project to [Volcengine VeFaaS platform](https://www.volcengine.com/product/vefaas) (you can use `veadk init` to init a demo project first)
- `veadk prompt`: otpimize the system prompt of your agent by [PromptPilot](https://promptpilot.volcengine.com)
- `veadk frontend`: serve the A2UI web UI together with the ADK agent API server
  and forward its validated OAuth access token when connecting to an AgentKit
  runtime protected by `custom_jwt`; customize its browser/sidebar branding with
  `--site-title` and `--site-logo`
- `veadk studio deploy`: deploy Studio and ensure its default IAM role has the
  required model, observability, search, security, memory, and identity system
  policies; custom local or remote logo images are bundled into the deployment
